instructions:

  - "Heat up oil in a pot, get it very hot, drop in chicken thighs (no bones), and get a crust on both sides"
  - "Toss into pressure cooker for 20 minutes"
  - "In the pot you cooked the chicken, sauté a whole onion (diced), half a garlic head (smashed) with a tsp of coriander and a touch of salt, until they brown and crisp a bit, remove and set aside"

  - "Once mloukiyeh softens up, add in a tsp of sweet pepper paste, and 3 tbsp of pomegranate molasses"
  - "Add in as much or as little water as desired"
  - "Once chicken is done cooking, chop it up, if it falls apart into shredded pieces, that's fine, it'll still be yummy :) add into the soup"
  - "Add half a lemon, but taste as you go, everyone likes the sourness level differently"
  - "When serving, add a spoon of your onion and garlic mix as a topping"
notes:
  - "Check leaves for any stray items before washing"
  - "Adjust lemon to taste - everyone has different preferences"
