ingredients:
  - "2 cups all-purpose flour"
  - "2 cups sugar"
  - "3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
  - "2 teaspoons baking powder"
  - "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda"
  - "1 teaspoon salt"
  - "1 teaspoon espresso powder (or instant coffee granules)"
  - "1 cup milk (or buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk)"
  - "1/2 cup vegetable oil (canola, or melted coconut oil)"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
  - "1 cup boiling water"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans."
  - "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder until well blended."
  - "Add milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until just combined."
  - "Reduce speed to low and carefully add the boiling water. The batter will be thin; that's normal for this cake."
  - "Divide batter evenly between the two pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean."
  - "Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely."
  - "Once completely cool, frost with chocolate buttercream frosting as desired."
notes:
  - "Adding espresso powder or instant coffee does not make the cake taste like coffee but enriches the chocolate flavor."
  - "You can substitute types of milk based on dietary preferences."
  - "The batter will be thin - this is normal and results in a moist cake."
