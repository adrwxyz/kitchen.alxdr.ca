ingredients:
  - "12 small to medium Lebanese zucchini (or calabaza squash, Mexican squash)"
  - "1 cup short-grain rice (Egyptian rice or Calrose rice)"
  - "500g (1 lb) minced beef or lamb (or a mix)"
  - "1 tbsp melted butter or ghee"
  - "1 tsp Lebanese seven-spice mix"
  - "1 tsp cinnamon"
  - "1 tsp white pepper"
  - "1 tsp black pepper"
  - "1 tsp salt (or to taste)"
  - "¼ cup chopped parsley or mint (optional)"
  - "2-3 large tomatoes, chopped (or 1 can tomato sauce, about 500g)"
  - "2 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "½ lemon, juiced (about 1 tbsp)"
  - "2 tbsp olive oil"
  - "3-4 cups water (enough to cover the zucchini)"
  - "Salt to taste for sauce"
  - "Extra tomato chunks to seal zucchini openings"
instructions:
  - "Prepare the Zucchini: Wash zucchinis and cut off the tops. Core each zucchini carefully using a zucchini corer, apple corer, or the handle of a teaspoon. Remove most of the flesh without piercing the bottoms or sides. Save the leftover cores for another recipe."
  - "Prepare the Filling: Rinse the rice several times and drain well. In a large bowl, combine rice, minced meat, melted butter or ghee, seven-spice mix, cinnamon, white pepper, black pepper, and salt. Mix well with your hands for best integration. Optionally add chopped parsley or mint for extra flavor."
  - "Stuff the Zucchini: Loosely fill each cored zucchini with the meat and rice mixture, leaving about ¾ inch unfilled at the top to allow rice to expand during cooking. Plug the opening with a chunk of tomato to keep the stuffing inside."
  - "Arrange in Pot: Place stuffed zucchinis standing upright (or snugly packed horizontally) in a large pot."
  - "Make the Sauce: In a separate bowl, mix chopped tomatoes or tomato sauce with minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Pour the tomato sauce over and around the zucchini in the pot. Add enough water to just cover the zucchinis."
  - "Cook: Cover the pot and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer gently for about 45-60 minutes, until zucchini is tender and the rice is fully cooked. Occasionally spoon some sauce over the zucchinis, and adjust seasoning if needed."
  - "Serve: Serve hot with plenty of the fragrant tomato sauce ladled over the stuffed zucchini."

## Notes

**For the best flavor:** This recipe is better with a fuller tomato sauce, not just tomato paste in boiling water. Use fresh tomatoes or good quality tomato sauce/passata for a richer, more flavorful result.

**Serving suggestions:** Serve with these traditional accompaniments on the side:
- Fresh lemon wedges
- Red pepper paste (muhammara)
- Garlic sauce (toum)
- Plain yoghurt (laban)

**Tips:**
- Short-grain rice is traditional for this recipe since it binds the filling nicely. Substitutes like basmati or long grain will yield a different texture.
- Coring and stuffing zucchini requires some practice. An electric zucchini corer makes it much easier if you plan to make this dish often.
- You can use the zucchini cores by sautéing them in olive oil with salt and pepper - perfect as a side dish!
- For extra flavor, add a little more lemon juice or dried mint in the last 10 minutes of cooking.
