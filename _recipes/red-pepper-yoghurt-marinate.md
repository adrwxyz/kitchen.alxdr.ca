# Notes

This recipe is really a guideline so you can play around with the proportions to your liking (add more pomegranate molasses to make it sweeter, more/less garlic)! I like to make this dish in a clean bowl and taste until I have the flavour I want. Then, I add my meat and marinate overnight in the fridge.
