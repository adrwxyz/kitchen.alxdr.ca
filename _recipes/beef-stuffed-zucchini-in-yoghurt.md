## Ingredients

- 8 large zucchini
- 1lb lean ground beef
- 1 onion
- Salt & Pepper
- 1/2 cup rice
- 2 cup water
- 750g plain 3% yoghurt
- 1/2 tsp corn starch

## Steps

Parallelize the steps with 2 pots by preparing the soup in one pot, and the zucchini and beef in the other. This recipe is much easier with two people!

- Beef
    - Sautee onions in oil
    - Add ground beef, pepper
    - Set aside and cool
- Zucchini
    - If using large zucchini, cut off stem and tip of zucchini then cut in half
    - Core zucchini so that 5mm / 1/8 inch of flesh remains as the outer circumference
    - Ensure that you leave the bottom intact so your filling doesn't fall out!
    - Fry zucchini in oil to partially cook (optional) then remove from pot to dry and cool
    - Once cool enough to hold, stuff insides with ground beef and onion mixture
- Soup
    - Lightly blend 1 cup water with yoghurt and corn starch
    - In large pot on high heat, add rice and 1 cup water
    - Once rice starts to steam before boiling, turn down to medium heat
    - Add blended yoghurt mixture
    - Important! Stir with flat wooden spoon constantly for the lesser of 20 minutes or steam rising again
    - Salt and pepper to taste
- Combine
    - Place upright stuffed zucchini in the finished soup

Note: you can use the zucchini cores by sautéing them in olive oil (add salt and pepper). This is perfect for garnishing your soup!
