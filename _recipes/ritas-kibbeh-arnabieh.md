  - "Add onion, parsley, 2 generous tbsp of tomato paste, 3 tbsp of pomegranate molasses, one tbsp of pepper paste, 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tbsp of dried mint, cracked pepper, juice of 1 lemon, cracked pepper and a bit of salt (key word, a bit, there are a lot of salty pastes, you can add salt later) all together"
  - "Blend in blender"
  - "Mix this into your hydrated bulgur, let it sit for 10 min and soak up the juices, taste and adjust flavour as needed"
  - "OPTIONAL: send it through a food processor to make into a paste, otherwise leave it if you like some texture"
  - "Wet your hands, and using a spoon shape it into mini-football shapes"
  - "Refrigerate immediately, and let it sit in the fridge for 20 minutes before serving"
  - "Serve with pomegranate molasses to dip - enjoy"
notes:
  - "You can freeze parsley stems for soup base"
  - "The bulgur will absorb the flavors as it sits"
