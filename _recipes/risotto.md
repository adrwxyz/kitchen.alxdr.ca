prep_time: '10'
cook_time: '25'
total_time: '35'
servings: '4-6'
ingredients:
  - "1/2 medium yellow onion (about 1 cup, finely chopped)"
  - "2 garlic cloves (pressed or grated)"
  - "1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil"
  - "2 cups Arborio rice"
  - "1 cup dry white wine"
  - "7-8 cups chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegetarian option)"
  - "4 tbsp unsalted butter (divided)"
  - "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (plus more to serve)"
  - "1 tbsp parsley (to garnish)"
  - "1/2 tsp fine sea salt (plus more to taste)"
  - "Fresh cracked black pepper (for garnish)"
instructions:
  - "Heat the stock in a separate saucepan and keep it at a gentle simmer."
  - "In a large heavy-bottomed pot or deep skillet, heat olive oil and 2 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until softened (about 3-4 minutes). Add garlic and cook just until fragrant."
  - "Stir in the Arborio rice and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly until the rice turns slightly translucent. This helps toast the grains for flavor."
  - "Add the white wine, stirring continuously until absorbed by the rice."
  - "Begin adding hot stock one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before pouring in the next. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and al dente (this takes about 18-20 minutes)."
  - "Stir in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan. Season with sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste."
  - "Remove from heat and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve with additional Parmesan on top."

## Tips for Perfect Risotto

- Use a short-grain, high-starch rice such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano for best results.
- Do not rinse the rice; the starch clinging to each grain creates creaminess.
- Add stock gradually and keep stirring to coax out the starch and ensure an even texture.
- The risotto should be creamy but not soupy – it should hold its shape on a plate but still spread slightly.
- Don't rush the process! Stirring releases the rice's starches, creating that silky texture.

## Variations

This classic risotto can be adapted to include:
- Cooked mushrooms
- Seafood (shrimp, scallops)
- Roasted vegetables
- Fresh herbs
