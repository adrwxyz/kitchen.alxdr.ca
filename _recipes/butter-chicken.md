instructions:
  - "Prepare the seasoning mix. In a container of a blender or food processor pulse 1 chopped onion, 5 cloves of chopped garlic, 2 chopped chili peppers, and a 3-inch knob of chopped ginger. Add a few splashes of water as you pulse until it becomes a paste-like consistency and set aside."
  - "In a medium mixing bowl, combine yogurt, 2 tablespoons of seasoning paste, 2 teaspoons each of chili powder, garam masala, ground cumin and 1 teaspoon of ground coriander. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Place in the fridge to marinate while you make the butter chicken sauce."
  - "In a small mixing bowl combine a tablespoon each of chili powder, garam masala, and cumin, 2 teaspoons of coriander, and ½ teaspoon of optional fenugreek."
  - "Heat a deep large heavy-bottomed pot on medium-high heat. Add  ghee and once it begins to smoke a bit, pour in the remaining seasoning paste and saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and beginning to brown slightly."
  - "Add the spice mix and cook an additional 5 minutes, while stirring often, until deep in colour, then stir in 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, cooking another 5 minutes, stirring frequently."
  - "Pour in a 28oz can of pureed tomatoes, 2 tablespoons of honey, then season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil, then lower heat to simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Uncover the pot and stir in a 14oz can of coconut milk. Adjust seasoning to taste."
  - "Preheat bbq on high heat. Transfer the marinated chicken onto skewers. Grill the chicken for 10 minutes, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly charred and cooked through."
  - "Remove the chicken from the skewers and stir into the butter chicken sauce. Continue to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes to incorporate the grilled flavour."
  - "Serve in a bowl with a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and a side of naan, flatbread, rice or potatoes."

Costco carries an excellent Butter Chicken sauce in a jar by a company called KFI Sauces that makes at home butter chicken a breeze.

## Steps

- Marinate chicken thighs in a bit of the sauce from the jar
- Sauté diced shallots in olive oil in a big pot
- Add rest of jar of sauce and leave on low heat
- BBQ or cook in cast iron pan the chicken thighs
- Shred or cut small chicken once cooked with fork and knife and add to big pot with sauce
- Serve over Basmattie rice

Optionally, you can cook separately diced potatoes and add to the sauce to make this more vegan.
