ingredients:
  - "Steak"
  - "1 1/2 pounds flank steak, cut into 1-inch cubes"
  - "fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper"
  - "1 tablespoon avocado oil (or any high-heat oil)"
  - "1–2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce"
  - "Sesame Cucumber Slaw:"
  - "1 (14-ounce) bag coleslaw (cabbag, carrot)"
  - "1 English cucumber, sliced into half moons"
  - "1 cup chopped fresh cilantro"
  - "2/3 cup thinly-sliced green onions"
  - "2 tablespoons rice vinegar"
  - "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce"
  - "1 tablespoon maple syrup"
  - "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil"
  - "optional: 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds"
  - "Spicy Sauce"
  - "1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt (or mayo)"
  - "2 tablespoons gochujang paste"
  - "Rice"
  - "1 1/2 cups white or brown rice"
instructions:
  - "Cook the rice.  Cook the rice according to package instructions."
  - "Make the sauce: Whisk together the Greek yogurt and gochujang until combined.  If you would like to turn the sauce into more of a drizzly dressing, whisk in a few extra tablespoons of water until the mix reaches your desired consistency.  (And if it tastes a bit too spicy for your liking, stir in some extra Greek yogurt.)"
  - "Make the slaw: Toss all ingredients together in a large bowl until combined."
  - "Cook the steak bites: Season the steak evenly with a generous pinch of salt and a few twists of freshly-cracked black pepper.  Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over high heat until it is shimmering.  (You want the pan to be very hot!)  Quickly add the steak bites to the pan in an even layer.  (If your pan is too small for the steak bites to fit in a single layer, I recommend cooking it in two batches.)  Cook the steak for 2 minutes without stirring.  Then flip and cook for 2-ish more minutes, or until the steak is seared on both sides and cooked to your desired level of doneness.  Transfer steak to a clean bowl and toss with the soy sauce."
  - "Assemble the bowls: In your serving bowls, layer a portion of rice, slaw, and steak bites.  Then drizzle generously with the spicy sauce, plus an optional extra sprinkle of chopped cilantro for garnish.  Enjoy!"
