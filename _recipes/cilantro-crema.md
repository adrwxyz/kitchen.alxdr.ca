A versatile creamy sauce with bright cilantro and lime flavors, perfect as a topping for tacos, grain bowls, grilled meats, or as a dip for vegetables. The combination of yogurt, sour cream, and mayo creates a rich yet tangy base that complements the fresh herbs and citrus.

Adjust to taste by adding more lime juice for brightness, salt for seasoning, or sumac for extra tang.
