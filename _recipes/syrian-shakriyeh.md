ingredients:
  - "1 kg (2.2 lbs) bone-in lamb shanks or shoulder pieces"
  - "2 liters (8 cups) full-fat plain yogurt"
  - "2 tablespoons cornstarch"
  - "1 egg"
  - "1 large onion, quartered"
  - "2 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "4 cups water (or enough to cover the meat)"
  - "2-3 cardamom pods"
  - "1 cinnamon stick"
  - "1 bay leaf"
  - "2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee"
  - "1 tablespoon dried mint (for garnish)"
  - "1/4 cup pine nuts (for garnish)"
  - "1 teaspoon salt (to taste)"
  - "1 teaspoon white or black pepper (to taste)"
instructions:
  - "Season lamb shanks with salt"
  - "Place lamb in a pressure cooker or large pot and add water to cover"
  - "Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that forms on the surface"
  - "Add quartered onion, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf to the pot"
  - "Cover and cook until lamb is very tender (30-40 minutes in pressure cooker, or 2-3 hours on stovetop)"
  - "In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, cornstarch, and egg until well combined (this stabilizes the yogurt)"
  - "Season the yogurt mixture with a little salt and pepper"
  - "Pour yogurt mixture into a large pot and heat gently over medium-low heat"
  - "Stir continuously until the yogurt starts to gently simmer and thicken (do not let it boil to prevent curdling)"
  - "Optional: add a ladle or two of the lamb broth to the yogurt to thin it slightly and add flavor"
  - "Add the cooked lamb pieces to the yogurt sauce"
  - "Simmer together for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to meld"
  - "In a small pan, heat oil and sauté minced garlic until fragrant"
  - "Stir the garlic oil into the stew"
  - "In the same pan, toast pine nuts until golden brown"
  - "Serve shakriyeh hot over fluffy white rice or rice pilaf"
  - "Garnish with toasted pine nuts and dried mint"
notes:
  - "Use full-fat yogurt for best results. Low-fat or Greek yogurt may not work as well."
  - "The egg and cornstarch help stabilize the yogurt so it doesn't separate when heated."
  - "You can substitute beef or veal for lamb if preferred, though lamb is most traditional."
  - "This dish is perfect for gatherings and special occasions."
  - "Traditionally served with Syrian-style rice (short-grain rice with vermicelli)."

Syrian Shakriyeh is one of the most iconic yogurt-based stews in Syrian cuisine. The velvety, tangy yogurt sauce beautifully balances the richness of slow-cooked lamb, creating a comforting and elegant dish that's perfect for family gatherings and special occasions.

The key to success is using full-fat yogurt and stabilizing it with egg and cornstarch to prevent curdling during cooking. The aromatic spices—cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaf—infuse the lamb with wonderful flavor, while the garlic oil and toasted pine nuts add a final touch of richness.
