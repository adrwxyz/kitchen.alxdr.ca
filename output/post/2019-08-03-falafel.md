- Put baking soda in one corner of chickpeas bowl

- Heat corn oil in pot on medium high heat until hot and ready for deep frying
    - If oil starts smoking, it is burning and won't be good! Let it cool or try again with new oil.
- Scoop into the hot oil 1.5 inch discs with an indent/hole poked in the middle (with the back of a spoon) for even cooking throughout
- Flip and wait until they float to the top of the oil
