## Ingredients

- 1/3 blend container walnuts
- 2/3 container roasted red peppers (from the jar that uses water â€“ not pickled in sunflower oil)
- 1/3 blend container olive oil
- Couple cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp roasted red pepper paste
- Salt

## Steps

Blend it!

## Notes

Great served along BBQ meat, for dipping veggies or simply spreading on bread!  
In the summertime, I like to add a couple fresh red peppers to brighten this dish up and use it as a veggie dip.
