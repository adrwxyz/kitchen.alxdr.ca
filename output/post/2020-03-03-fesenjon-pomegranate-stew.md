Estimate serves 8-12 meals

### Walnuts

1\. Toast 1 pound (about 4-4.5 cups) walnuts using one of these methods:  
a) spread in a single layer in large skillet and toast on medium high, stirring frequently until lightly toasted  
b) spread them in a single layer in a baking sheet and toast at 350F in the oven 8-10 min. Be sure to keep an eye on them  
_meanwhile, you can start the sauté section if you’re feeling confident and chop your shallots_  
2\. Allow walnuts to cool enough to handle.  
_work on sauté_  
3\. Place in blender and blend until coarse mixture

### Sautee

Finely chop 3 shallots

**In the a sauce pan:**

- Heat 3 tbsp olive oil or 3 tbsp butter
- Sauté 3 finely chopped shallots in olive oil/butter until lightly brown.
- Add the following spices and toast 2 minute more
    - 1/2 tsp cinnamon
    - 1/2 tsp nutmeg
    - 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
    - 1/2 tsp salt
    - 1 stick cinnamon
    - 1 full cardamom pod or 1 piece cardamom

### All Together

**To the crockpot, add all the ingredients:**

- 4 lb meat (traditionally made with chicken but chicken, veal, stewing beef, chickpeas are all okay too. Fish is a big no-no in this recipe)
- Ground walnut paste (if gets stuck, blend some water to get it out)
- Sautéed shallots and spice
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 150 mL pomegranate molasses

**Mix well at this point then add liquids**

- 3 cups water or chicken stock until meat is covered
- Juice and zest from 1 orange

Cook covered on high for 4h or until meat is tender  
Cook uncover and cook on low for 1h, stir every 15 minutes, if you desire a thicker consistency  
Place cover back on and keep warm until ready to serve

Serve on top of rice and garnish with fresh pomegranate
