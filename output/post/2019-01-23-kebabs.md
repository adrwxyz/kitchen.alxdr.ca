## Ingredients

- Ground Beef
- Onions, diced
- Salt
- Mint (finely chopped fresh, or dried)

## Steps

- Prepare all your fresh ingredients
- Mix ingredients with ground beef
- Shape mixture into patties or form on skewers
- BBQ until cooked to your liking

## Notes

Serve kebabs on pita bread or over rice with your favourite salad (tabouleh, fattoush, etc) and sauce (muhammara or taziki).

If your ground beef is dry, add a spoon of olive oil to add fat and flavour.

Optionally sub fresh parsley or fresh basil for mint.
