## Ingredients

- 500-600g of your favourite mushroom (we like brown Mini Bellas from Costco)
- 1/2 cup Butter
- Olive oil
- 1 large garlic
- Optional ½ shallot
- Salt & pepper
- 300-400ml 35% cream
- 300-400ml Milk
- 250-500ml Water (or your choice of broth)

## Steps

- Heat over medium-high heat ¼ cup butter and ¼ cup olive oil in a big pot
- Slice and add mushrooms, sautéed until the mushrooms brown
- Add ¼ tsp black pepper
- Mushrooms will let out water, remove half of the water into a bowl for later
- Add more butter and olive oil as necessary and cook down
- Mince and add garlic (and shallot) and wait to brown
- Add more butter and olive oil as necessary and cook down
- It’s time to make it a roux! Add half cup of flour and mix continuously
- Gradually add 300-400ml of 35% cream mixing continually until it is a paste-like roux
- Once fully formed into a roux, add 300-400ml milk, 250ml cup of water, and the previously set aside mushroom broth
- Add generously fresh ground pepper and some salt to taste
- Mix and add additional 250ml of water if consistency is too thick
- Add a sprig of thyme whole, crush a sprig into it, and leave it to simmer on medium heat
