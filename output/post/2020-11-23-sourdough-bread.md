We've gone through many iterations of Sourdough and saved our favourite recipes and resources below.

## Rustic Sourdough Bread

This one turns into more of a "farmers loaf" similar to what you'd find in a local grocery store bakery, less of the traditional sourdough composition, but much simpler to bake.

### Metrics

- Prep: 12 mins
- Bake: 25-30 mins
- Total: 3hr 7mins
- Yield: Two 10" loaves, 32 servings

### Ingredients

- 1 cup (227g) ripe (fed) sourdough starter
- 1 ½ cups (340g) lukewarm water
- 1-2 tsp instant yeast
    - When using sourdough discard (instead of fed) use 1.5x additional instant yeast
- 2 ½ tsp salt
- 5 cups (602g) all purpose flour

### Instructions

- Combine all of the ingredients, kneading to form a smooth dough (we use KitchenAid stand mixer with dough hook)
- Allow the dough to rise in a lightly greased, covered bowl, until it's doubled in size, about 90 mins
- Gently divide the dough in half, it'll deflate somewhat
- Gently shape the dough into two oval loaves; or, for longer loaves, two 10" to 11" logs. Place the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425ºF
- Spray the loaves with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour
- Make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread knife, wielded firmly, works well here
- Bake the bread for 25-30 mins, until it's a very deep golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack
