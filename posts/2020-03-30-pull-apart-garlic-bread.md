# Ingredients

- 1 cup 8 oz warm water
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter softened
- 1 cup 8 oz milk (I used 1%)
- 2 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 5 1/2 - 6 1/2 cups 1 lb 9 oz - 2 lbs 3 oz bread flour

# For Topping:

- 8 tablespoons butter melted
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley finely chopped (or 4 teaspoons dried)
- 2 Tablespoon fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 4 cloves garlic minced
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt

# Steps

- Add warm water to the bowl of a [stand mixer](http://amzn.to/1Wd5VAG) fitted with dough hook. Sprinkle water with sugar and yeast. Stir and let stand 5-10 minutes until foamy. 
- Mix in butter, milk, salt and 3 cups flour. Stir in additional flour gradually. Add enough flour until dough is smooth. Knead for 7-10 minutes. Dough should stick to the bottom of the bowl but clears sides. It will be soft and slightly sticky. (Kneading can also be kneaded by hand by will take closer to 10 minutes to a achieve a smooth dough.) Divide dough into 2 equal portions.
- In a small bowl, combine the butter, parsley, oregano and minced garlic. Set aside. 
- Cut dough into 1-in. pieces; dip into butter mixture. Layer the buttery pieces into 2 – greased [8-in. x 4-in. loaf pans](http://amzn.to/1XrYPYh). Cover loaves and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile preheat oven to 350 degrees 15 minutes prior to the full rise.
- Bake at 350° for 30 minutes or until golden brown. The temperature of the baked loaves should read 200 degrees. Sprinkle with kosher salt.
