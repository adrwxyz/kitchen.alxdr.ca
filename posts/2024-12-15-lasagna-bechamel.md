# Instructions

1. Make the Meat Sauce:

  - Brown the meat - In a large pot, heat the 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and pork and season with salt and pepper. Cook the meat until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside.
  - Sauté the vegetables and add the flavorings - Heat the remaining olive oil over medium heat and add the onion, carrot, and celery. Sauté until softened. Add the garlic, rosemary, oregano, bay leaves, fennel seeds, and chili flakes, and cook for another minute to release their flavors. Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute.
  - Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer the sauce - Return the browned meat to the pot and add the red wine, cook over low heat until most of the wine has cooked away. Stir in the whole peeled tomatoes and beef stock. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Let it cook uncovered for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it will become. You can add more stock or water as needed.
Season - Taste the sauce and season with a little more salt and pepper.


2. Prepare the Lasagna Sheets - You have a couple of options when it comes to lasagna sheets. Choose the one that suits you best:
  
  - Homemade Pasta Sheets: If you want to go the extra mile, make your own pasta sheets using our favorite pasta dough recipe. Roll out the dough into thin sheets and cut them into rectangular lasagna sheets.
  - Fresh Pasta Sheets (Store-Bought): If you're short on time, you can find fresh lasagne sheets in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. They're usually pre-cut to fit a standard lasagna dish.
  - Dried Lasagna Sheets (Oven-Ready): This is our personal favorite! No-boil lasagna sheets are a convenient option that doesn't require precooking. Simply follow the instructions on the package for layering them in your lasagna.
Dried Lasagna Noodles (Requires Boiling): If you prefer the traditional method, boil lasagna sheets are the way to go.


3. Make Béchamel Sauce:

  - Start by scalding the milk - In a small, heavy-based saucepan, heat the milk with the onion, bay leaf, and peppercorns until just below boiling point. Remove from heat. Cover with a lid and infuse the milk for 20-30 minutes, then strain and discard the flavorings.
  - Make the roux - Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the flour while whisking constantly. Keep whisking until the mixture is smooth, ensuring the roux doesn't brown.
  - Add the milk - Gradually add hot milk whisking constantly until smooth. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 3 - 5 minutes stirring from time to time until the sauce becomes thick and creamy.
Season - Add freshly grated nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.


4. Assemble the Lasagna - Now comes the fun part – layering the lasagna!
How to layer a lasagna:

- Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a large baking dish, more or less 25cm x 30cm (9x13-inch).
- Place a layer of lasagna sheets on top of the sauce, covering it completely.
- Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the lasagna sheets, followed by a layer of meat sauce.
- Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the sauces.
- Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top. (A traditional lasagna has 3 - 5 layers of pasta)

5. Bake the Lasagna - Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil, ensuring it doesn't touch the cheese. Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 30 - 35 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbling.

6. Rest Lasagna before serving - as much as it’s tempting you to dig in right away, allowing your lasagna to rest uncovered for 20 - 30 minutes after baking is a game-changer. As it cools down, the layers set and firm up, ensuring each serving is a delightful stack of well-defined layers instead of a soupy mess.
