A delicious way to make both boiled veal and a simply beef stock.

## Steps

- Wash veal in sink to get rid of bone shards
- Add to big pot filled 60-80% with water (should be proportional to the amount of veal so that it isn't too diluted or concentrated)
- Add spices from bag
- Add a few black peppercorns
- Add a little salt, not too much
- Simmer on medium heat for a long time (3+ hours)
- Skim off foam periodically

A staple at the Alexander house.
