Serves 4

# Thit Nuong (Pork)

- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons minced shallots
- 3 tablespoons finely minced lemongrass
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound pork shoulder, thinly sliced into 2-3 inch strips

# Pickled Carrots and Cucumbers

- 2 medium carrots, peeled and julienned
- 1 large cucumber, peeled and julienned
- 1 cup rice wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar

# Nuoc Cham (Seasoned Fish Sauce)

- 1/2 cup fish sauce
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar, lemon, or lime juice
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1-2 red Thai chiles, stem removed and minced

# Mo Hanh (Scallion Oil)

- 1/4 cup canola oil
- 1/2 cup chopped scallions

# For assembling

- 8 ounces Bun rice noodles, cooked and refrigerated
- 2 cups lettuce, thinly sliced
- 1 1/2 cups fresh bean sprouts
- 1 cup fresh cilantro
- 1/2 cup roasted peanuts, crushed

To prepare the pork marinade: In a large bowl or large ziploc bag, combine soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, and brown sugar. Mix in shallots, lemongrass, cilantro, garlic, green onions, and black pepper. Add the pork, tossing to coat thoroughly.Refrigerate 30-45 minutes.

To prepare the carrots and cucumber: Toss the julienned carrots and cucumber in a medium bowl. Add enough rice wine vinegar to cover. Sprinkle with sugar. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To prepare the Nuoc Cham: In a medium bowl, whisk together fish sauce, water, sugar, and vinegar until sugar dissolves. Whisk in garlic and chiles. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble.

To make the scallion oil: In a small skillet, drizzle canola oil over low heat. Once heated, add the chopped scallions and cook just until the green parts begin to wilt, but are still bright, 2-3 minutes.

Place a grill, grill pan, or large skillet over medium high heat. Lightly grease with oil. Remove the pork from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature 5-10 minutes. Once the grill/skillet is heated, grill the meat in a single layer in batches until browned, 1-2 minutes. Flip to brown the other side, another 1-2 minutes. Repeat with remaining pork.

Divide cooked rice noodles among serving bowls. Top with lettuce, cilantro, and bean sprouts, then carrots/cucumber and grilled pork. Brush the pork with the green onion oil. Sprinkle with peanuts and serve immediately with nuoc cham.
