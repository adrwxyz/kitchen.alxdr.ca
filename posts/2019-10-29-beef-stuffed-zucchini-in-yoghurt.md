# Ingredients

- 8 large zucchini
- 1lb lean ground beef
- 1 onion
- Salt & Pepper
- 1/2 cup rice
- 2 cup water
- 750g plain 3% yoghurt
- 1/2 tsp corn starch

# Steps

Parallelize the steps with 2 pots by preparing the soup in one pot, and the zucchini and beef in the other. This recipe is much easier with two people!

- Beef
  - Sautee onions in oil
  - Add ground beef, pepper
  - Set aside and cool
- Zucchini
  - If using large zucchini, cut off stem and tip of zucchini then cut in half
  - Core zucchini so that 5mm / 1/8 inch of flesh remains as the outer circumference
  - Ensure that you leave the bottom intact so your filling doesn't fall out!
  - Fry zucchini in oil to partially cook (optional) then remove from pot to dry and cool
  - Once cool enough to hold, stuff insides with ground beef and onion mixture
- Soup
  - Lightly blend 1 cup water with yoghurt and corn starch
  - In large pot on high heat, add rice and 1 cup water
  - Once rice starts to steam before boiling, turn down to medium heat
  - Add blended yoghurt mixture
  - Important! Stir with flat wooden spoon constantly for the lesser of 20 minutes or steam rising again
  - Salt and pepper to taste
- Combine
  - Place upright stuffed zucchini in the finished soup

Note: you can use the zucchini cores by saut√©ing them in olive oil (add salt and pepper). This is perfect for garnishing your soup!
