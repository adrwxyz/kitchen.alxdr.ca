- 3/4 c. packed fresh cilantro leaves
- 3/4 c. packed fresh parsley leaves
- 1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 3 tbsp. red wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp. fresh lime juice
- 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Pinch of red pepper flakes
- 1 lb. flank steak

## Creamy Jalapeno Sauce

- 1 jalapeño, stem and seeds removed
- 1/2 medium avocado
- 1/2 c. sour cream
- 1/4 c. fresh cilantro
- 1 clove garlic
- 3 tbsp. fresh lime juice
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Bowls
- 4 c. water
- Kosher salt
- 1 c. farro, rinsed
- 1 c. corn kernels, thawed if frozen
- 1 (15-oz.) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 4 c. packed arugula
- 1 c. halved cherry tomatoes
- Chopped avocado and crumbled feta, for serving


# Steps

## Chimichurri Marinade

- In a food processor, pulse cilantro, parsley, oil, garlic, vinegar, lime juice, salt, a few cracks of black pepper, and red pepper flakes until combined and herbs are finely chopped. Pour 1/4 c. marinade into a resealable bag; reserve remaining marinade for serving.
- Add steak to bag and massage marinade into steak. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes or refrigerate up to 2 hours.

## Creamy Jalapeno Sauce

- In food processor or blender, combine jalapeño, avocado, sour cream, cilantro, garlic, and lime juice; season with salt and black pepper. Blend, adding water 1 tbsp. at a time if necessary, until smooth.

## Bowls

- In a medium pot over high heat, bring water and a couple large pinches of salt to a boil. Add farro, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.
- Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook steak until desired degree of doneness, about 8 minutes per side for medium. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Slice against the grain into strips or bite-size pieces.
- In same skillet over medium heat, cook corn, undisturbed, until charred on bottom, about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes more. Add beans and cook, stirring, until combined and warmed through, about 1 minute.
- Divide arugula among bowls. Top with farro, corn and beans, steak, tomatoes, and avocado. Drizzle with reserved chimichurri and jalapeño sauce. Top with feta.
