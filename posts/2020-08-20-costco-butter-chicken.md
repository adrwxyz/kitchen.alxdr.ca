Costco carries an excellent Butter Chicken sauce in a jar by a company called KFI Sauces that makes at home butter chicken a breeze.

# Steps

- Marinate chicken thighs in a bit of the sauce from the jar
- Saut√© diced shallots in olive oil in a big pot
- Add rest of jar of sauce and leave on low heat
- BBQ or cook in cast iron pan the chicken thighs
- Shred or cut small chicken once cooked with fork and knife and add to big pot with sauce
- Serve over Basmattie rice

Optionally, you can cook separately diced potatoes and add to the sauce to make this more vegan.
