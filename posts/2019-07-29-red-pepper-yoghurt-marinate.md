# Ingredients

- 1-2 tbsp roasted red pepper paste
- 5 tbsp yoghurt
- 1-2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
- Salt
- Garlic (optional)

# Notes

This recipe is really a guideline so you can play around with the proportions to your liking (add more pomegranate molasses to make it sweeter, more/less garlic)! I like to make this dish in a clean bowl and taste until I have the flavour I want. Then, I add my meat and marinate overnight in the fridge.
