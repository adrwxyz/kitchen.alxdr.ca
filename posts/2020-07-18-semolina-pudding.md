## Ingredients

- 1 bag milk
- ½ cup semolina flour
- Water
- 50ml Orange blossom water
- ½ cup sugar
- Crushed pistachios (optional)

## Steps

- Put a layer of water to cover the bottom of a pot
- Empty the entire bag of milk
- Add half cup of semolina flour and stir in briefly
- Put over high heat stirring frequently or medium heat sitting until it starts to come to a boil
- If consistency is still mostly liquid, add a bit more semolina
- Be careful not to stir too much or semolina flour will clump
- Turn heat down and stir so it doesn’t stick to the bottom
- Add sugar
- Leave on low heat stirring every ~5 minutes until it thickens
- Once thick, drizzle 2-3 capfuls / 50ml of orange blossom water and stir in
- Let sit 5 minutes and then spoon out into serving bowls or ramekins
- Optionally top with crushed pistachios
- Let cool and place in fridge to solidify and thicken
