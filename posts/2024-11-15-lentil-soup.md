- 1.5 cups Red Lentils
- 6 cups Water or Vegetable stock
- 1 Bouillon Cube
- 1 cup Carrots chopped
- 1 Onion chopped
- 2 Garlic cloves chopped
- 1 tbsp Olive oil
- Salt & Pepper to taste
- 1 tsp Cumin
- 1/2 tsp Turmeric

## What to serve this soup with:
- Lemon wedges

# Instructions
- In a pot, add the olive oil. To that, add the onions, garlic, and carrots. Add salt and pepper to this and then saute for 5 minutes until fragrant.
- To that, add the lentils and saute for a few minutes. Season with the cumin, turmeric, and crushed bouillon cube. Mix together.
