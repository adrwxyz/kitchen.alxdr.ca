# Ingredients

- 500ml 35% cream
- 6 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla (paste)
- More sugar for topping (1 tbsp each)

# Steps

- Add eggs and 1/4 cup sugar to a mixing bowl, whisk until smooth. Don't over whisk.
- Add cream and 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla to a pot on the stove. Use any of the following to add extra flavor
    - Squeeze oranges
    - Splash of Bailey's
    - Green tea
- Bring to a boil and remove from heat
- While whisking slowly pour the hot cream into the egg mixture. Again, don't over whisk. Don't scramble eggs.
- Strain custard into a pitcher to pour
    - At this step, you could switch it up and instead of creme brulee, make ice cream by putting this mixture in an ice cream machine
- Prepare a oven proof tray with 5 ramekins in it. Fill the ramekins 3/4 full
- Add water to your oven tray to create a water bath for your ramekins, water should go halfway up the sides
- Bake in a 350F oven for 30ish minutes give or take
- Brulees are done when the tops have a slight browning and they jiggle, but don't wobble
- Allow to cool fully
- Sprinkle sugar over the tops and use a torch to caramelize the sugar
- Allow to harden before eating
