# Roasted Vegetables
- 1 Red onion
- 1 Butternut Squash - small
- 10 Baby potatoes
- 2 Carrot
- 2 Parsnips
- 1 tbsp Olive oil
- 1 pinch Sea salt and black pepper

# Salad
- 4 Handfuls of Watercress/Rocket (arugula) salad mix
- 1 tbsp Olive oil
- 2 tbsp Balsamic vinegar
- 2 tbsp Fresh basil - finely chopped
- 2 tbsp Fresh coriander (cilantro) - finely chopped
- 2 tbsp Fresh parsley - finely chopped
- 1 pinch Sea salt and black pepper
- 30 g Light Feta - (or dairy-free equivalent)

# Instructions
- Chop all the vegetables so they are fairly chunky. Put them in a bowl with 1 tbsp of olive oil and some salt and pepper and mix well.
- Put onto a baking tray in a preheated oven at 200°C/400°F/Gas 6 for 35-40 minutes.
- Make the salad dressing by mixing together the olive oil, balsamic, salt, pepper and herbs.
- Remove the vegetables from the oven.
- Divide the salad between 2 bowls and top with roasted vegetables. Drizzle the dressing on top and crumble over the feta.

# Notes
- Roast any vegetables you have that need using up. Cauliflower and broccoli roast well too.
- Mix up the salad greens by adding some spinach and kale.
- Keep the salad vegan by skipping the feta, or using an alternative.
- Add some extra texture to this salad by sprinkling some seeds on top before serving.
- Next time I would add some lemon juice and zest to the salad dressing too.
- Give the warm salad a protein boost with some chickpeas or grilled chicken.
- Add some pomegranate on top for an extra burst of colour and flavour.
- For some sweetness, thinly sliced apple is a really nice addition to to a winter salad.
