# Ingredients

## Butter Chicken Sauce
- 1 yellow onion chopped
- 5 cloves garlic chopped
- 3-inch knob of ginger chopped
- 2 chili peppers chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground fenugreek optional
- ¼ cup ghee or coconut oil
- 3 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 can 796ml/28oz ground tomatoes
- 1 can 398/14oz coconut milk
- 2 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
salt and pepper

## Chicken Marinade
- 2 lbs chicken thighs boneless, skinless - cubed
- ¼ cup yogurt
- 2 tablespoon seasoning paste from butter chicken sauce method
- 2 teaspoon chili powder
- 2 teaspoon garam masala
- 2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander

# Steps

- Prepare the seasoning mix. In a container of a blender or food processor pulse 1 chopped onion, 5 cloves of chopped garlic, 2 chopped chili peppers, and a 3-inch knob of chopped ginger. Add a few splashes of water as you pulse until it becomes a paste-like consistency and set aside.
- In a medium mixing bowl, combine yogurt, 2 tablespoons of seasoning paste, 2 teaspoons each of chili powder, garam masala, ground cumin and 1 teaspoon of ground coriander. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Place in the fridge to marinate while you make the butter chicken sauce.
- In a small mixing bowl combine a tablespoon each of chili powder, garam masala, and cumin, 2 teaspoons of coriander, and ½ teaspoon of optional fenugreek.
- Heat a deep large heavy-bottomed pot on medium-high heat. Add  ghee and once it begins to smoke a bit, pour in the remaining seasoning paste and saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and beginning to brown slightly.
- Add the spice mix and cook an additional 5 minutes, while stirring often, until deep in colour, then stir in 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, cooking another 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
- Pour in a 28oz can of pureed tomatoes, 2 tablespoons of honey, then season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil, then lower heat to simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Uncover the pot and stir in a 14oz can of coconut milk. Adjust seasoning to taste.
- Preheat bbq on high heat. Transfer the marinated chicken onto skewers. Grill the chicken for 10 minutes, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly charred and cooked through.
- Remove the chicken from the skewers and stir into the butter chicken sauce. Continue to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes to incorporate the grilled flavour.
- Serve in a bowl with a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and a side of naan, flatbread, rice or potatoes.
