# Ingredients

- Veal ribs on bone
- Beef bones with marrow
- Water

# Steps

- Add veal and bones to pot
- Fill and empty pot with water three times to clean veal and bones
- Fill with water so that all meat and bones are covered
- Boil on high heat taking care to reduce heat if it starts to boil over
  - Scoop off any foam or thick bubbles that may collect for a cleaner broth
- Season to taste
  - Salt
  - Peppercorns
  - Cardamon pods
  - Bay leaves
- After 1 hour, there should be a thick clear fat layer forming at the top, it may be orange in colour depending on your meat
- After 3-4 hours, the rolling boil should have a more uniform consistency across the broth
- Empty into containers and remove the meat
- Optionally re-fill with fresh water and boil the bones again, a second boil can often pull a lot of remaining fat and nutrients out that the first boil missed
