Simple pasta using freezer or often at-hand ingredients.

# Ingredients

- 250g Pasta (for 2 people)
- Shrimp, frozen, tail-off (easiest)
- 3-4 whole tomatoes diced or 20 cherry tomatoes
- Olive oil
- Garlic

# Steps

- Cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain cooked pasta from water once al dente, save 200ml of pasta water.
- Heat pot, add frozen shrimp. Salt, pepper. Cook until pink on each side, then remove. Remove and drain shrimp cooking water too.
- Heat olive oil in saucepan, add diced domatoes, salt. Cook 2-3 minutes until softened.
- Add garlic, cook 1 more minute.
- Add back to sauce the set aside shrimp.
- Add pasta and mix, add some pasta water if the sauce is still too thick. Add a little, mix, and reevaluate. Don't add all at once.
- Serve with fresh grated parmesan to taste.

# Notes
- Use olive oil, not coconut or something else.
- Don't put pasta in until shrimp is done so pasta is complete when the sauce is ready.
- Freshly grated parmesan, no sawdust.
