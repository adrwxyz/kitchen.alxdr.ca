# Ingredients

* 8 large zucchini
* 1-2lb lean ground beef
* 1 onion
* Black pepper
* 1/2 cup rice
* 2 cup water
* 750g plain 3% yoghurt
* 1/2 teaspoon corn starch

# Steps

Parallelize the steps with 2 pots by preparing the soup in one pot, and the zucchini and beef in the other.

* Beef
  * Sautee onions in oil
  * Add ground beef, salt, pepper
* Zucchini
  * Half and cut off stem and tip of zucchini
  * Core zucchini so that 5mm / 1/8 inch of flesh remains
  * (optional) Fry zucchini in oil to partially cook
  * Remove from pot to dry and cool
  * Once cool enough to hold, stuff insides with ground beef
* Soup
  * Lightly blend 1 cup water, yoghurt, and corn starch
  * In large pot on high heat, add rice and 1 cup water
  * Once it starts to steam before boiling, turn down to medium heat
  * Add blended yoghurt mixture
  * Important! Stir with flat wooden spoon constantly for the lesser of 20 minutes or steam rising again
* Combine
  * Place upright in the finished soup to maintain maximum ground beef in each zucchini when served
